// 1. Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
// 2. Variable names cannot contain spaces.
// 3. Variables cannot be the same as reserved keywords such as if or const.
// 4. By convention, JavaScript variable names are written in camelCase.
// 5. Variables should be given descriptive names that indicate their content and usage.
// 6. As JavaScript variables do not have set types, it can be useful to include an indication of the type in the name.
